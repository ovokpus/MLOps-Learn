# üóí What is MLOps?

When machine learning (ML) is used to solve a business problem, one could argue that delivering the model output to the end-user in a reliable way is an integral part of the machine learning process.

## üîÅ ML Model Life-Cycle

For a clearer picture, we can look at a life-cycle of a machine learning model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph ML Model
        D([Monitor]) -.->|retrain when performance drops| B([1. Train])
        B --> C([2. Deploy])
        C --> D([3. Monitor])
        end
        A([Data & <br>Problem Design]) --->|if ML helps solve problem| B
```

- **Data & Problem Design**: Choose machine learning to solve a problem when there is no other more straightforward approach and the data has sufficient quality.
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Train**: Train and evaluate ML models and choose the best performing one.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Deploy**: Integrate the chosen model into the production environment (web service, module, embedded system, etc.)
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Monitor**: Capture the model's performance in the production environment and define a threshold for an acceptable value.

Depending on the use case, team skills, and established best practices, each of the life-cycle stages could be realized manually or with more automation support. MLOps is a practice that could support the maturity of the life-cycle iterations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

MLOps brings DevOps principles to machine learning. It is a set of best practices to put ML models into production and automate the life-cycle.

MLOps could help to

- track model iterations and reproduce results reliably,
- monitor model performance and deliver domain-specific metrics for ML,
- and deliver models safely and automatically into production.

## üìà MLOps Maturity Model

The extent to which MLOps is implemented into a team or organization could be expressed as maturity. A framework for classifying different levels of MLOps maturity is listed below:

A high maturity level is not always needed because it comes with additional costs. The trade-off between automated model maintenance and the required effort to set up the automation should be considered. An ideal maturity level could be picked based on the use case / SLAs and the number of models deployed.
